Proxmox binary comes in form of .iso file; it would be a better Ideo to use a USB and Rufus to achieve a faster Installation. 

At the beginning we get a screen of choices; just select " install proxmox VE"

If you wish, you can configure your own file format-specific raid via Proxmox. Since there is a Raid Structure on the servers used by many System Administrators, we can switch to the next screen by saying "Next" without doing anything in this section.
