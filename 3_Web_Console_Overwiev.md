##DNS
if we have a custom dns server in
our network, we should make sure that
the ip address for that matches right
here.
![local_user_mng2](images/console7.png)

##Hosts
wW have access
to the host file for the server
so if there's any static host entries
that you want to add here you can
definitely do that
now i actually recommend  avoid this
if you can because it's better to use
dns for hostname lookups, anyway
so if you have access to a dns server i
recommend you add any entries there
because that makes those particular
entries available anywhere on your
network.
but if you do have a reason to update
the  /etc/host file you can do that here
